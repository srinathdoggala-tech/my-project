Live Character Counter :
This experiment is about creating a small webpage that shows the number of characters typed in a text box, instantly as you type.

What it does :
You see a text area where you can type anything.
Below the text area, a counter shows how many characters you have typed.
As soon as you type or delete something, the number updates automatically.

How it works :
HTML creates the structure:
A box (container) that holds the heading, text area, and the counter.
The <textarea> lets the user type.
A <span> is used to display the live count of characters.

CSS styles the page:
Adds borders and spacing to make it look neat.
Makes the textarea bigger and comfortable to type in.
Displays the counter clearly with bold text.

JavaScript makes it interactive:
It “listens” to the typing event in the textarea.
Every time you type or erase, it calculates the total characters (textarea.value.length).
It updates the counter on the screen in real time.

Why it’s useful :
Helps in situations where there’s a character limit (like tweets, SMS, or forms).
Easy to understand for beginners learning web development.
Demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.
