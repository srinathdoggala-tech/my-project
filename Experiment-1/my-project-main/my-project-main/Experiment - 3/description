Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Theme Switching
In this experiment we have created three files to perform the full experiment one for html(admin.html), one for css (admin.css) and another one for java script (admin.js).
In the html file we created the basic structure for the admin dashboard using body tag , head tag , header tag , navigation tag (nav) ,grid tag ,and etc.
In CSS file we have used we have used body and many classes with many other different properties as they required for structuring the different area of web page as given in question. We have to use different classes for for different area to style it as required and have to apply the properties accordingly.
In JavaScript code adds dark mode functionality to the webpage. When the checkbox with ID modeToggle is toggled, it adds or removes the dark-mode class on the body element, switching between light and dark themes dynamically.
