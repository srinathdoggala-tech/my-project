we have done all this in Experiment 2 for creating the banking UI with balance , deposit and 
withdraw buttons. we have used many function or tags of html like margin, padding , align 
firstly we have created a html file named index.html which contain head  and body tag measurly
then we have created a css file named style.css in which we used body tag and many classes in 
html like .container , .amount , .btn , .deposit and .withdraw. within these classes we used 
many properties to design the banking UI.
